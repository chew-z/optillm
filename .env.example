# Usage Examples:
#
# 1. Use predefined complex model:
#    model="bon-rapid"   → Uses OPTILLM_BON_CONFIG_RAPID (fast models)
#    model="bon-deep"    → Uses OPTILLM_BON_CONFIG_DEEP (diverse models)
#    model="bon-coding"  → Uses OPTILLM_BON_CONFIG_CODING (coding-focused)
#    model="moa-rapid"   → Uses OPTILLM_MOA_CONFIG_RAPID (fast agents)
#    model="moa-deep"    → Uses OPTILLM_MOA_CONFIG_DEEP (diverse perspectives)
#    model="moa-coding"  → Uses OPTILLM_MOA_CONFIG_CODING (coding agents)
#
# 2. Use specific model for all roles (homogeneous):
#    model="zai/glm-4.7" with approach="bon" → All candidates use zai/glm-4.7
#    model="gpt-4o" with approach="moa"      → All agents use gpt-4o
#
# 3. Fallback to default when model is missing:
#    Uses OPTILLM_MODEL (glm-4.7) for all candidates/agents
